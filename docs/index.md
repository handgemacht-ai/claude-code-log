# Claude Code Log

A Python CLI tool that converts Claude Code transcript JSONL files into readable
**HTML** and **Markdown**, with an interactive **TUI** for browsing and managing
your sessions.

## Quickstart

Run the command below and browse pages generated from your entire Claude Code
archive:

```sh
uvx claude-code-log@latest --open-browser
```

Or launch the interactive terminal UI:

```sh
uvx claude-code-log@latest --tui
```

## What it does

`claude-code-log` reads the transcripts Claude Code stores under
`~/.claude/projects/` and turns them into clean, navigable logs so you can:

- Review and search all your Claude Code conversations
- See what you worked on yesterday, last week, or in a date range
- Track token usage and session costs
- Share a conversation as a self-contained HTML page
- Feed a past session back to an LLM as Markdown for analysis

## Key features

- **Interactive TUI** — browse, export, and resume sessions from your terminal
- **Project hierarchy processing** — convert your whole `~/.claude/projects/` tree with a linked index
- **Per-session HTML** — individual pages with navigation between sessions
- **Token usage tracking** — per-message and per-session totals
- **Runtime message filtering** — show/hide message types in the browser
- **Interactive timeline** — zoomable, click-to-scroll conversation navigation
- **Date range filtering** — natural language (`"today"`, `"last week"`)
- **Detail levels & compact mode** — `--detail` and `--compact` for LLM-friendly Markdown
- **Server-side Markdown** — syntax-highlighted rendering via mistune
