"""MkDocs build hooks.

The developer docs under ``dev-docs/`` (surfaced on the site as the *Development*
section) and the root ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` link to source files in the repository
— e.g. ``../claude_code_log/cli.py`` or ``test/README.md``. Those targets are
not part of the documentation site, so under ``mkdocs build --strict`` they would
be flagged as broken links.

Rather than rewrite the source Markdown (which must keep working for people
reading the repo directly), this hook rewrites such links to absolute GitHub
URLs at build time via the ``on_page_markdown`` event.
