## Motivation

Currently, messages are sorted by timestamp and then patched with post-hoc
fixups (pair reordering, sidechain reordering by `agentId`). This is fragile:

- **Sync agents**: Works "well enough" because timestamps align with causality
- **Async agents** (#90): Agent runs in background; launch and notification
  are temporally distant; agent transcript interleaves arbitrarily
- **Teammates** (#91): Multiple agents send messages concurrently
- **Resume/fork** (#85): Conversation branches share a prefix; timestamp
  ordering can't express the branching structure

The transcript data already contains the structural information we need:
each message's `parentUuid` points to its predecessor, forming a DAG.

---

## Core Concepts

### The DAG

Every message has a `uuid` and a `parentUuid` (null for first messages).
Together they form a directed acyclic graph. The graph is the authoritative
ordering; timestamps are metadata, not structure.

### Sessions and DAG-lines

A **session** is the set of messages sharing a `sessionId`. Each session
forms a single contiguous chain in the DAG — its **DAG-line**. A session's
DAG-line contains only the messages unique to that session (after
deduplication).

**Assertion**: Within a session, the default `parentUuid` chain is linear.
Explicit rewinds create within-session forks that are rendered as branch
pseudo-sessions. Unexpected non-rewind branching logs a warning.

### Junction Points

A **junction point** is a message whose `uuid` is referenced as
`parentUuid` by messages from **different sessions**. This is where
resume/fork happens.

Junction points are **annotations on messages**, not splits of DAG-lines.
A session's DAG-line remains intact; the junction point simply records
"session N forks/continues from here."

### Session Tree

Sessions form a tree:

- **Root sessions**: Their first message has `parentUuid: null` (or points
  to a message not in any loaded session, e.g. after a `/clear`)
- **Child sessions**: Their first unique message's `parentUuid` points into
  a parent session's DAG-line

Children are ordered chronologically (by their first message's timestamp).

Example:

```
Session 1: a → b → c → d → e → f → g
                             ↑           ↑
                             |           |
Session 3: k → l → m        Session 2: h → i → j
(fork from e)                (continues from g)
```

Session tree:
```
- Session 1
  - Session 2 (continues from g)
  - Session 3 (forks from e)
```

Rendered message sequence (depth-first, chronological children):
```
s1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, s2, h, i, j, s3, k, l, m
```

Where `s1`, `s2`, `s3` are synthesized session header messages.

### Navigation Links

- **Forward links** on junction points: "Session N forks/continues here"
  (shown on message `e` and `g` in the example above)
- **Backlinks** on session headers: "Continues from message X in Session Y"
  (shown on `s2` and `s3`)

#### Current: `d-{index}` anchors (combined transcript only)

Backlinks use `#msg-d-{N}` anchors which are sequential indices assigned
during rendering. These are stable within a single render pass (the
combined transcript is always regenerated whole), but shift when any
session grows.

This works for the combined transcript because all links and targets are
on the same page. Individual session pages have independent indices.

#### Future: UUID-based anchors for cross-page linking

Each session's DAG-line can grow independently. If session B grows and
its page is regenerated, `d-{index}` values shift — breaking any link
from session A's (cached) page into B.

When cross-session-page links are needed (e.g. session page A links to
a junction point in session page B), add stable UUID-based anchors:

```html
<div id="msg-{uuid}" ...>  <!-- stable, never shifts -->
```

Use `msg-{uuid}` on junction points and attachment messages. Keep
`msg-d-{N}` for everything else (session nav, timeline, etc.).

### Deduplication

When session 2 resumes session 1, Claude Code may replay prefix messages
(d', e', f', g') into session 2's file. These duplicates share the same
`uuid` but have a different `sessionId`.

Resolution: deduplicate by `uuid`, keeping the instance from the
**earliest session** (by first message timestamp). The "new" messages in
session 2 (those with previously-unseen `uuid`) form its DAG-line.

### Agent Transcripts

Agent transcripts also form DAG-lines. They come in two flavors:

1. **Continuing agents**: Their `parentUuid` chains into a previous agent's
   DAG-line (same session, different `agentId`). These naturally fit the
   DAG.

2. **Top-level agents**: `parentUuid` is null. These need explicit
   **parenting** — splicing them into the main session's DAG-line at the
   appropriate point.

   For `x → y → z` where `y` is a Task, and agent transcript `u → v` needs
   to be rooted at `y`, the result is: `x → y → u → v → z`.

**Parenting strategies** (by agent type):

| Agent type | Link mechanism | Parent at |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Sync Task | `agentId` on tool_result | Task tool_result message |
| Async Task (#90) | `agentId` on launch tool_result, `task-id` in `<task-notification>` | Launch tool_result |
| Teammate (#91) | `team_name` + agent name | TBD — likely TeamCreate or Task-with-team |

## Algorithm

### Phase 1: Load All Sessions

Load **all** `.jsonl` files for a project directory. Build a unified message
index:

```python
messages_by_uuid: dict[str, TranscriptEntry]   # uuid → entry (oldest wins)
children_by_uuid: dict[str, list[str]]          # parentUuid → [child uuids]
sessions: dict[str, list[str]]                  # sessionId → [uuids in chain order]
```

When targeting a single session, still load all files but only render
that session's subtree. Optionally warn that context from other sessions
is available.

### Phase 2: Build DAG and Deduplicate

1. Parse all entries, index by `uuid`
2. For duplicate `uuid`s, keep the one from the earliest `sessionId`
3. Build `children_by_uuid` from `parentUuid` links
4. Group messages by `sessionId`

### Phase 3: Extract Session DAG-lines

For each session (`extract_session_dag_lines` in `dag.py`):
1. Identify the session's unique messages (those whose authoritative
   `sessionId` matches)
2. Find roots (nodes whose `parent_uuid` is null or points outside the
   session). A session may have **multiple roots** — see
   [Compact Boundaries and Multi-Root Sessions](#compact-boundaries-and-multi-root-sessions).
3. Walk each root via `_walk_session_with_forks`, following same-session
   children. Single-child → chain continues. Multiple same-session
   children → distinguish real forks from artifacts using the heuristics
   below.
4. Merge trunk DAG-lines from multiple roots into a single chain
   (ordered by `first_timestamp`); branch DAG-lines stay separate.
5. If DAG walk coverage is incomplete, fall back to a timestamp sort for
   the whole session.

### Phase 4: Build Session Tree

1. For each session, find where its DAG-line attaches to the DAG:
   - Walk back from the session's first unique message via `parentUuid`
   - The first message belonging to a **different** session is the
     attachment point
2. The session whose message is the attachment point is the parent session
3. Root sessions have no attachment point (first message is `parentUuid: null`
   or points outside loaded data)
4. Order children chronologically

### Phase 5: Identify Junction Points

A message is a junction point if `children_by_uuid[msg.uuid]` contains
messages from multiple sessions, or from a session different than the
message's own.

Annotate junction points with their target sessions for forward-link
rendering.

### Phase 6: Splice Agent Transcripts

For each agent transcript (identified by `agentId`):
1. Determine parenting strategy (see table above)
2. Find the anchor message in the main session's DAG-line
3. Splice the agent's DAG-line after the anchor

This replaces the current `_reorder_sidechain_template_messages` approach
with a principled graph operation.

### Phase 7: Process and Render

Within each DAG-line, apply existing processing:
- Pairing (tool_use+tool_result, thinking+assistant, etc.)
- Hierarchy building
- Tree construction

Pairing should be **scoped to DAG-lines** — no pairing across session
boundaries. This is both correct and faster.

## Caveats

### Context Compaction Replays

When Claude Code compacts context (inserting a `SummaryTranscriptEntry`), it
**replays** the conversation from a certain point with **new UUIDs** but the
**same `parentUuid` and timestamp** as the original entries. This creates
multiple same-session children from a single parent — structurally identical
to a user rewind (fork), but semantically a replay.

**Distinguishing heuristic**: timestamps.

- **Real fork (rewind)**: the user goes back and types a new message at a
  different time → children have **different** timestamps.
- **Compaction replay**: the system re-emits the same turn → children share
  the **same** timestamp as the original.

When `_walk_session_with_forks()` encounters a node with multiple same-session
children that all share the same timestamp, it follows only the **first**
child (the original chain) and ignores the later replay chains. This avoids
creating hundreds of false branch pseudo-sessions in long-running sessions
with frequent compaction.

The heuristic is validated on real data: across all fork points, forks
partition cleanly into same-timestamp (compaction) vs different-timestamp
(rewind) groups, with no mixed cases observed.

### Tool-Result Side-Branches

When the assistant makes **multiple tool calls** in one turn, the JSONL
records both the next `tool_use` and the previous `tool_result` as children
of the same parent entry. Without intervention this creates a fake fork at
every parallel-tool_use turn. `_stitch_tool_results()` and the all-passthrough
clause in `_walk_session_with_forks()` detect three patterns and splice the
side-branch back into the main chain.

#### Variant 1 — User child's subtree is purely structural

The `tool_result` for the first parallel call is recorded as a sibling of
the `tool_use` for the second call. The `tool_result` itself is conversation
content, but its subtree carries only a `hook_success` attachment leaf and
no further user/assistant descendants.

Pre-fix DAG (looks like a fork):

```mermaid
graph TD
    A1["A(tool_use₁)"] --> U1["U(tool_result₁)"]
    A1 --> A2["A(tool_use₂)"]
    U1 --> H["📎 attachment (hook_success)"]
    A2 --> U2["U(tool_result₂)"]
    U2 --> rest["..."]
    classDef structural fill:#eef,stroke:#99c
    class H structural
```

Post-fix — `_is_structural_subtree(U₁)` returns true (no user/assistant
descendants), so `U₁` is stitched into the chain ahead of the continuation
`A₂`, and the attachment is collapsed in as a non-rendered side entry:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A1["A(tool_use₁)"] --> U1["U(tool_result₁)"]
    U1 --> A2["A(tool_use₂)"]
    A2 --> U2["U(tool_result₂)"]
    U2 --> rest["..."]
```

The earlier "no immediate same-session child" check missed Variant 1 when
a `hook_success` attachment sat under the `tool_result`. That's the shape
of all 22 fake forks observed in the BCT Teamcenter 1594-entry test file.

#### Variant 2 — Assistant subtree dead-ends

Claude Code sometimes emits a second `tool_use` that terminates without
producing a continuation — a progress artifact. The `tool_result` for the
first call **does** continue the main conversation, so the fix stitches the
dead `tool_use` subtree into the chain before the continuing `tool_result`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A1["A(tool_use₁)"] --> U1["U(tool_result₁)"]
    U1 --> Amain["A(response) — continues"]
    A1 --> A2["A(tool_use₂)"]
    A2 --> U2["U(tool_result₂) — dead end"]
    classDef dead fill:#fee,stroke:#c99
    class A2,U2 dead
```

Detected by `_is_subtree_dead_end()`: exactly one user child has a live
continuation; every assistant child's subtree dead-ends within the session.

#### Structural-only fork — all children are passthrough

Every same-session child is a `PassthroughTranscriptEntry` (attachments,
`hook_success`, `SessionStart:resume`), often at far-apart timestamps so
the compaction-replay heuristic doesn't apply. Neither "branch" carries
conversation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["A(assistant)"] --> P1["📎 hook_success"]
    A --> P2["📎 SessionStart:resume"]
    classDef structural fill:#eef,stroke:#99c
    class P1,P2 structural
```

Handled directly in `_walk_session_with_forks` **before** `_stitch_tool_results`
is called: when every child is a passthrough **and** each child's subtree
is itself structural (defense-in-depth for hypothetical future passthrough
types with conversational descendants), collapse all children into the
chain and terminate there.

#### Summary of detection criteria

| Pattern | Detection | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Variant 1 | `_is_structural_subtree(U)` true for every user child; exactly one assistant continuation | Splice user children ahead of assistant continuation |
| Variant 2 | `_is_subtree_dead_end(A)` true for every assistant child; exactly one user continuation | Splice assistant children ahead of user continuation |
| Structural-only | Every child is `PassthroughTranscriptEntry` with structural subtree | Collapse all into chain, end |
| Real rewind | Multiple children with conversational subtrees at different timestamps | Real within-session fork → branch pseudo-sessions |
| Compaction replay | Multiple children sharing the same timestamp | Follow first, skip rest (see next section) |

Subtree descendants of stitched/collapsed side-branch nodes are added to
the `skipped` set for coverage accounting, so the "DAG walk coverage
incomplete" fallback doesn't fire.

### Compact Boundaries and Multi-Root Sessions

When the user runs `/compact`, Claude Code writes a `system/compact_boundary`
entry with `parentUuid: null`, followed by a user entry carrying the summary
(parsed as `CompactedSummaryMessage`). The pre-compaction context (often
100k+ tokens) is replaced by the summary — a real content discontinuity.

Because the boundary entry has no parent, it becomes a **fresh root within
the same `sessionId`**. A session that was `/compact`ed once has 2 roots;
twice has 3. Early `local_command` entries (e.g. `/memory`) sometimes land
as orphan roots too.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Session s1 — 3 roots after two /compact runs"
        direction TB
        U0["U: initial prompt — root 1 (parentUuid:null)"] --> A0["A: response"]
        A0 --> more1["..."]
        more1 --> CB1["system/compact_boundary — root 2 (parentUuid:null)"]
        CB1 --> CS1["U: summary (CompactedSummaryMessage)"]
        CS1 --> after1["..."]
        after1 --> CB2["system/compact_boundary — root 3 (parentUuid:null)"]
        CB2 --> CS2["U: summary (CompactedSummaryMessage)"]
    end
    classDef root fill:#ffd,stroke:#a80
    class U0,CB1,CB2 root
```

**Multi-root handling in `extract_session_dag_lines`** (dag.py):

1. Walk every root via `_walk_session_with_forks` (not just the earliest)
   so orphan-promoted subtrees are covered.
2. Merge non-branch DAG-lines from all roots into a single trunk, ordered
   by `first_timestamp`.
3. Classify roots to decide log level:
   - `_EXPECTED_ROOT_SYSTEM_SUBTYPES = {"compact_boundary", "local_command"}`
   - If every non-primary root is an expected system subtype → `logger.debug`
   - Otherwise (orphan user/assistant hinting at a missing parent) →
     `logger.warning` with unexpected count

This keeps the signal useful: orphan user/assistant entries still surface
as warnings; routine `/compact` multi-root sessions stay quiet.

**Nav landmarks** (`build_session_nav` in renderer.py): each
`CompactedSummaryMessage` in a session becomes an `is_compaction_point`
nav item (📦 glyph, solid border, depth = parent+1), chronologically
ordered. Clicking jumps to the summary's `#msg-d-X` anchor so the reader
can jump to any compaction point from the session index. Compact points
inside a branch are correctly scoped via `render_session_id`.

---

## Assertions / Invariants

These should be checked at runtime (log warnings, don't crash):

1. **Session trunk is linear after stitching**: each session's non-branch
   DAG-line is a single chain. Branching within a `sessionId` comes from
   exactly three sources:
   - **Explicit user rewinds** → rendered as branch pseudo-sessions
   - **Parallel tool_use / dead-end tool_use / all-passthrough
     children** → stitched or collapsed (not rendered as branches); see
     [Tool-Result Side-Branches](#tool-result-side-branches)
   - **Compaction replays** (same-timestamp children) → first child only
2. **Multi-root sessions are tolerated**: `/compact` and `local_command`
   produce multiple roots within one `sessionId`; all are walked and the
   trunks are merged. Other multi-root causes warn (may indicate missing
   parent data).
3. **DAG acyclicity**: No cycles in `parentUuid` chains
4. **Unique ownership**: After deduplication, each `uuid` belongs to
   exactly one session
5. **Agent parenting**: Every top-level agent transcript has an identifiable
   anchor in the main session
6. **DAG walk coverage**: `walked | skipped` must equal the session's
   node set; if not, fall back to a timestamp sort for the whole session
   and log a warning

## Impact on Existing Code

### What changes

| Component | Current | After |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `converter.py` | Load single file + agent files; timestamp sort | Load all project files; build DAG |
| `renderer.py` message ordering | Timestamp sort + pair reorder + sidechain reorder | DAG-line traversal; pairing within DAG-lines |
| Session index | Flat list sorted by timestamp | Session tree with parent/child relationships |
| Agent handling | `agentId`-based insertion after timestamp sort | Agent DAG-line splicing at anchor points |

### What stays

- Factory layer (transcript entry → MessageContent)
- TemplateMessage wrapper and RenderingContext
- Hierarchy building within sessions (user → assistant → tools)
- Renderer dispatch and format_* methods
- HTML templates and JavaScript (fold, timeline, filters)
- Deduplication heuristics (sidechain cleanup, etc.) — may simplify over time

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A: DAG Infrastructure (new module: `dag.py`)

1. **Message indexing**: Load all session files, build `uuid` index,
   deduplicate
2. **DAG construction**: Build parent→children graph
3. **Session extraction**: Group by `sessionId`, extract DAG-lines,
   verify linearity
4. **Session tree**: Build parent/child session relationships, identify
   junction points

This phase is purely additive — new code alongside existing. Tests can
validate DAG construction against known transcripts.

### Phase B: Integration with Rendering Pipeline

1. Replace `load_transcript` / `load_directory_transcripts` with
   DAG-based loading in `converter.py`
2. Pass DAG-lines (per session) into `generate_template_messages`
3. Scope pairing to DAG-lines
4. Generate session headers with navigation links (forward/back)
5. Update session index from flat to hierarchical

### Phase C: Agent Transcript Rework (Steps 1-2 done)

1. ~~Implement parenting strategies for each agent type~~ — Done:
   `_integrate_agent_entries()` parents agent roots to anchors and assigns
   synthetic session IDs (`{sessionId}#agent-{agentId}`)
2. ~~Replace `_reorder_sidechain_template_messages` with DAG-line splicing~~
   — Done: agents are now DAG-ordered; the old function is kept as fallback
3. Simplify or remove `_cleanup_sidechain_duplicates` (dedup now
   happens at DAG level) — TODO
4. Agent tool renderer (separate PR, `dev/user-sidechain` branch) — TODO

### Phase D: Async Agent and Teammate Support

1. Parse `<task-notification>` to extract `task-id` for async agent linking
2. Implement teammate parenting strategy (#91)
3. This is where #90 and #91 get properly resolved
